# Pathfinder
PathFinder is a tool to visulise the internal working of path finding algorithms.  

Algoriths Used  
A*(With 4 different heuristics)  
DFS  
BFS  
Dijkstra's Algorithm  
Bidirectional (To be added)  

It is visually asthetic and shows perfectly how path different path algorithms work using beautiful animations.  

# To be added
Random Maze Generator  
Bidirectional path finder  

# Features
Start and End positions can be changed easily using drap and drop
